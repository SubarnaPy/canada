# Hero Component Update - Conditional Rendering for Logged-in Users

## ✅ Changes Made

### Problem:
When a user is logged in, they still see the "Get Started Today" signup form on the homepage, which is not relevant since they're already registered.

### Solution:
Updated the Hero component to show different content based on authentication status:

## 🎨 New Features

### For **Non-Logged-In Users** (Same as before):
- Shows "Get Started Today" signup form
- Email/Phone input field
- "Send OTP" button
- Google and Facebook login options
- Terms and Privacy Policy links

### For **Logged-In Users** (NEW):
- **Welcome Message Card** with personalized greeting
  - "Welcome back, [FirstName]! 👋"
  - "Ready to continue your Canadian journey?"

- **Hero Image** - Canadian Journey themed image
  - Uses `/src/assets/canadian-journey.jpg`
  - Matches the UI theme with dark overlay
  - Professional and welcoming design

- **Quick Access Buttons** at the bottom:
  - "My Dashboard" - navigates to `/dashboard`
  - "Browse Services" - navigates to `/services`

## 📁 Files Modified

### `src/components/Hero.tsx`

#### Imports Added:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";
import { Link, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
```

#### Key Changes:
1. **Authentication Check:**
   ```typescript
   const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
   const navigate = useNavigate();
   ```

2. **Conditional Rendering:**
   ```typescript
   {!isAuthenticated ? (
     // Signup Form
   ) : (
     // Welcome Image with Quick Actions
   )}
   ```

3. **Personalization:**
   - Uses `user?.firstName` for personalized greeting
   - Fallback to 'User' if name not available

4. **Navigation:**
   - Dashboard button → `/dashboard`
   - Browse Services button → `/services`

## 🎨 Design Features

### Welcome Card Design:
- **Background:** Gradient from `#181A20` to `#0B0E11`
- **Border:** Yellow/gold (`#F0B90B`) with 10% opacity
- **Shadow:** Glow effect matching the theme
- **Image:** Full-height cover image with gradient overlay
- **Overlays:** Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur

### Visual Elements:
1. **Welcome Message (Top Left):**
   - Dark background with 80% opacity
   - Backdrop blur for modern glass effect
   - Yellow border accent

2. **Hero Image:**
   - Full cover of the card
   - Gradient overlay (bottom to top)
   - Maintains aspect ratio

3. **Quick Actions (Bottom):**
   - Same glass effect as welcome message
   - Two prominent action buttons
   - Yellow primary button + outlined secondary

## 🖼️ Image Requirements

The component uses: `/src/assets/canadian-journey.jpg`

### Recommended Image Characteristics:
- **Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 or similar (portrait/square)
- **Minimum Size:** 800x1000px
- **Theme:** Canadian landmarks, people settling in Canada, or welcoming scenes
- **Colors:** Should complement the dark theme with yellow accents
- **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display

### Alternative Images in Assets Folder:
If `canadian-journey.jpg` doesn't exist, you can use:

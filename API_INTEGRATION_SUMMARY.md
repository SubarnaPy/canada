# API Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Created Files:
- **`backend/routes/services.js`** - New API routes for services and reviews
  - `GET /api/services` - Get all services
  - `GET /api/services/:id` - Get single service by serviceId
  - `GET /api/services/category/:category` - Get services by category
  - `GET /api/services/:id/reviews` - Get reviews for a specific service
  - `GET /api/services/all/reviews` - Get all reviews

#### Modified Files:
- **`backend/server.js`** - Registered the new services routes
  ```javascript
  app.use('/api/services', require('./routes/services'));
  ```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Modified Files:
- **`src/pages/ServiceDetail.tsx`**
  - Added `useEffect` hook to fetch data from backend API
  - Added loading and error states with proper UI
  - Commented out all hardcoded `serviceData` and `reviewsData`
  - Now fetches services and reviews from MongoDB via API
  - Added TypeScript interfaces for Service and Review types
  - Added Loader2 icon for loading state

### 3. Key Features

✅ **Service Data Flow:**
1. Data is stored in MongoDB (uploaded via seedData.js)
2. Backend API serves data through Express routes
3. Frontend fetches data using fetch API
4. Loading states and error handling implemented

✅ **User Experience:**
- Shows loading spinner while fetching data
- Displays error message if service not found
- Gracefully handles API failures
- Reviews are limited to first 4 (slice(0, 4))

## How to Use

### Start the Backend Server:
```powershell
cd backend
node server.js
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Start the Frontend:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Test the API:
```powershell
cd backend
node testAPI.js
```

## API Endpoints

### Services
- **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/services` - All services
- **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/services/1` - Service with ID 1
- **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/services/category/Settlement%20%26%20Integration` - Services by category

### Reviews
- **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/services/all/reviews` - All reviews
- **GET** `http://localhost:5000/api/services/1/reviews` - Reviews for service ID 1

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

**Important:** The `VITE_API_URL` already includes `/api`, so in your code, you should use:
```typescript
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/services`) // NOT /api/services
```

For production, change to your production API URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api`).

## Database Schema

### Services Collection:
```javascript
{
  serviceId: Number,
  title: String,
  category: String,
  description: String,
  aboutService: String,
  price: String,
  duration: String,
  rating: Number,
  reviews: Number,
  consultant: String,
  consultantTitle: String,
  features: [String],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Reviews Collection:
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  rating: Number,
  date: String,
  comment: String,
  serviceId: Number (optional),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Update Services.tsx** - Fetch all services from API instead of hardcoded data
2. **Add Review Submission** - Create POST endpoint for users to submit reviews
3. **Add Filtering** - Filter services by category using the API
4. **Add Pagination** - Implement pagination for services and reviews
5. **Add Search** - Implement search functionality using MongoDB text search
6. **Error Boundaries** - Add React error boundaries for better error handling
7. **Caching** - Implement caching with React Query or SWR

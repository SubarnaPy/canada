# Hero Section Step-by-Step Signup Form Update

## Summary
Updated the Hero section's authentication form to replace the OTP-based signup with a **step-by-step, single-field** registration system. Users can now register directly from the hero section using ONE field that progressively collects information without needing to navigate to a separate registration page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Step-by-Step Wizard Form
- **Single Field Design**: Only ONE input field visible at a time
- **Progressive Data Collection**: Each step collects one piece of information
- **Visual Progress Indicator**: 5-step progress bar shows current position
- Users move through the form step by step with a "Continue" button

### 2. Registration Flow (5 Steps)
The form guides users through these steps in order:

**Step 1: Email**
- User enters their email address
- Email validation happens before proceeding

**Step 2: First Name**
- User enters their first name
- Minimum 2 characters required

**Step 3: Last Name**  
- User enters their last name
- Minimum 2 characters required

**Step 4: Password**
- User creates a password
- Password visibility toggle available
- Minimum 6 characters required

**Step 5: Confirm Password**
- User confirms their password
- Password visibility toggle available
- Must match the original password
- Final "Sign Up" button creates the account

### 3. Features Added
- ✅ **Single field focus** - No overwhelming multi-field forms
- ✅ **Progress indicator** - Visual 5-step progress bar
- ✅ **Back button** - Users can go back to edit previous entries
- ✅ **Auto-focus** - Input field automatically focused for better UX
- ✅ **Password visibility toggle** (Eye/EyeOff icons)
- ✅ **Real-time validation** at each step
- ✅ **Previous entries preview** - Shows email and name below the current field
- ✅ **Loading states** during authentication
- ✅ **Success/error toast notifications**
- ✅ **Direct registration** without leaving the page
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** between steps

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **No OTP Required**: Users can now register with just email and password
- **Less Overwhelming**: One field at a time reduces cognitive load
- **Clear Progress**: Visual indicator shows how far along they are
- **Easy Navigation**: Back button allows users to correct mistakes
- **Contextual Prompts**: Each step has clear instructions
- **Previous Data Visible**: Users can see what they've already entered
- **Fast & Simple**: Quick signup flow without distractions
- **Professional UI**: Maintains the dark theme with gold accents

### 5. Technical Details

#### New Imports Added:
```typescript
import { Eye, EyeOff } from "lucide-react";
import { useState } from "react";
import { toast } from "sonner";
```

#### New State Variables:
- `step`: Current step in the wizard ('email' | 'firstName' | 'lastName' | 'password' | 'confirmPassword')
- `email`: User's email address (collected in step 1)
- `firstName`: User's first name (collected in step 2)
- `lastName`: User's last name (collected in step 3)
- `password`: User's password (collected in step 4)
- `confirmPassword`: Password confirmation (collected in step 5)
- `currentInput`: The current value in the single input field
- `showPassword`: Toggle password visibility (steps 4 & 5)
- `isLoading`: Loading state during API calls

#### Form Submission Logic:
The form handles each step sequentially:
1. **Email Step**: Validates email format, stores it, moves to firstName
2. **First Name Step**: Validates length (min 2 chars), stores it, moves to lastName
3. **Last Name Step**: Validates length (min 2 chars), stores it, moves to password
4. **Password Step**: Validates length (min 6 chars), stores it, moves to confirmPassword
5. **Confirm Password Step**: Validates match with password, calls `signup()` API

Each step shows appropriate success/error messages via toast notifications. Users can click "Back" to return to previous steps and edit their entries.

### 6. Benefits
1. **Less Overwhelming**: One field at a time reduces form anxiety
2. **Better Focus**: Users concentrate on one piece of information at a time
3. **Faster Registration**: Streamlined flow feels quicker
4. **Better UX**: No need to navigate away from the hero section
5. **Reduced Friction**: No OTP waiting time or complex forms
6. **More Secure**: Password-based authentication with confirmation
7. **Error Handling**: Validates each field before proceeding
8. **Easy Corrections**: Back button allows fixing mistakes
9. **Mobile Friendly**: Single field works great on small screens
10. **Higher Conversion**: Simpler forms typically have better completion rates

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Step 1 (Email)**: Test with invalid emails, verify validation works
2. **Step 2 (First Name)**: Test with empty/short names, verify minimum length
3. **Step 3 (Last Name)**: Test with empty/short names, verify minimum length
4. **Step 4 (Password)**: Test with short passwords (< 6 chars), verify validation
5. **Step 5 (Confirm Password)**: Test with mismatched passwords, verify error
6. **Back Navigation**: Click "Back" button at each step, verify data is preserved
7. **Progress Bar**: Verify progress indicator updates correctly at each step
8. **Complete Flow**: Test full signup flow with valid data
9. **Toast Notifications**: Verify success/error messages appear correctly
10. **Password Toggle**: Test show/hide password functionality
11. **Auto-focus**: Verify input field auto-focuses at each step
12. **Loading States**: Verify loading state shows during final signup
13. **Previous Data Display**: Check that email and name show below the input field after step 1

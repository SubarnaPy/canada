# Payment Success Page Fix & Webhook Secret Update

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Payment Success Page 404 Error
**Problem:** After successful Stripe payment, users were getting a "Page not found" error when redirected to `/payment-success`

**Root Cause:** Missing `_redirects` file in Netlify deployment. This file is required for client-side routing (React Router) to work properly on Netlify.

**Solution:** Created `public/_redirects` file with the following content:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle routing on the client side.

### 2. âœ… Webhook Secret Updated in Both Backends

Updated `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET` to: `whsec_zGuvucDVuinMsOQ8918miRS5FPeaF1sn`

**Files Updated:**
- `new-canadian-nexus-main/backend/.env`
- `nexus-settle-admin-main/backend/.env`

## Deployment Status

### Frontend (new-canadian-nexus-main)
- âœ… Changes committed to Git
- âœ… Pushed to GitHub (SubarnaPy/canada)
- ðŸ”„ Netlify will automatically deploy the changes
- **URL:** https://gleaming-raindrop-809582.netlify.app

### Testing Instructions

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Netlify to complete the automatic deployment
2. Test the payment flow:
   - Go to your website
   - Select a service and initiate payment
   - Complete Stripe checkout (use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - You should be redirected to `/payment-success` without 404 error

3. **Test direct URL access:**
   - Visit: https://gleaming-raindrop-809582.netlify.app/payment-success?session_id=test
   - Should see the Payment Success page, not a 404 error

## Webhook Configuration

Make sure your Stripe webhook endpoint is configured:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks
2. Your webhook endpoint should be: `https://your-backend-url/api/webhook/stripe`
3. Webhook secret: `whsec_zGuvucDVuinMsOQ8918miRS5FPeaF1sn`
4. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `new-canadian-nexus-main/backend/.env` - Updated webhook secret
2. âœ… `nexus-settle-admin-main/backend/.env` - Updated webhook secret  
3. âœ… `new-canadian-nexus-main/public/_redirects` - Created for Netlify routing

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Netlify deployment (should complete automatically)
2. Test payment flow end-to-end
3. Verify webhook is receiving events in Stripe Dashboard
4. Check that payment records are being created in your database

## Notes

- The `_redirects` file is essential for any SPA (Single Page Application) deployed on Netlify
- Without it, direct URL access or page refreshes will result in 404 errors
- The webhook secret must match between your Stripe webhook configuration and your .env file
- Remember to restart your backend servers to pick up the new webhook secret

## Troubleshooting

If the payment success page still shows 404 after deployment:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check Netlify deployment logs for any build errors
3. Verify the `_redirects` file is in the deployed `public` folder
4. Check Netlify's "Redirects and rewrites" section in site settings

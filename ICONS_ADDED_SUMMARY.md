### 4. Updated ServiceTiles Component
**File:** `src/components/ServiceTiles.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Added API Integration:**
   - Now fetches services from backend instead of using hardcoded data
   - Added loading and error states

2. **Added Icon Mapping:**
   ```typescript
   const iconMap: Record<string, any> = {
     Home, Briefcase, Rocket, Scale, Shield,
     GraduationCap, DollarSign, FileText,
     Heart, Users, Truck, Smartphone
   };
   ```

3. **Dynamic Icon Rendering:**
   - Maps icon names from database to Lucide icon components
   - Fallback to Briefcase icon if icon not found

4. **Console Logging:**
   - Logs service fetching process
   - Shows which services are loaded with their icons

5. **Commented Out Hardcoded Data:**
   - Original hardcoded services array is now commented out

### 5. Updated ServiceDetail Interface
**File:** `src/pages/ServiceDetail.tsx`
- Added `icon?: string` field to Service interface

## üé® How It Works

1. **Backend:**
   - Services stored in MongoDB with icon field (e.g., "Home", "Briefcase")
   - API endpoint `/api/services` returns services with icon names

2. **Frontend:**
   - ServiceTiles component fetches services from API
   - Icon names are mapped to actual Lucide icon components
   - Icons render dynamically based on database values

3. **Icon Mapping Logic:**
   ```typescript
   const Icon = service.icon ? iconMap[service.icon] || Briefcase : Briefcase;
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Check Console Logs:
When you visit the homepage, you should see:
```
üîÑ Fetching services from backend...
üì• Response Status: 200
‚úÖ Successfully fetched 16 services from backend!
üì¶ Services: [Array of services with icons]
```

### Verify in Browser:
1. Open the application
2. Scroll to "Complete Service Ecosystem" section
3. Each service card should display its appropriate icon
4. Icons should match the service category

## üöÄ Benefits

‚úÖ **Centralized Data Management** - Icons stored in database
‚úÖ **Easy Updates** - Change icons via database without code changes
‚úÖ **Consistent Design** - All services use Lucide icons
‚úÖ **Scalable** - Easy to add new icons or services
‚úÖ **Type Safe** - TypeScript interfaces ensure data integrity

## üìù Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add icon field to Services.tsx page
2. Add icon customization in admin panel
3. Add icon preview in service detail page
4. Add icon color variations per category
5. Add animated icons on hover

## ‚ú® Result

All service icons are now stored in MongoDB and rendered dynamically from the database! The frontend fetches the icon names and maps them to the appropriate Lucide icon components for display.

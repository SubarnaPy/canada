# Booking Dialog Authentication Improvements

## Summary
Updated the BookingDialog component to provide a better user experience for authenticated users and enforce authentication for booking services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Check on Dialog Open
- When a user tries to book a service, the system now checks if they are logged in
- If **not authenticated**: User is redirected to the login page with a toast notification
- If **authenticated**: The booking dialog opens normally

### 2. Auto-Fill User Information
When a logged-in user opens the booking dialog:
- **Full Name**: Auto-filled with `firstName + lastName` from user profile
- **Email**: Auto-filled with user's email address
- **Phone Number**: Auto-filled with user's phone (if available)

### 3. Read-Only Fields for Authenticated Users
For logged-in users, the following fields are now:
- **Disabled/Read-only**: Cannot be edited
- **Visually distinct**: Shows as disabled (60% opacity) to indicate pre-filled status
- **No asterisk**: The required indicator (*) is removed since fields are pre-filled

### 4. Updated Validation Logic
- **For non-authenticated users**: Name, Email, and Date are required
- **For authenticated users**: Only Date is required (other fields are pre-filled)
- Improved validation messages for better user feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
- `src/components/BookingDialog.tsx`

### Key Changes
1. Added `user` from `useAuth()` context
2. Added `useEffect` hook to check authentication and pre-fill data when dialog opens
3. Updated form inputs with `disabled={isAuthenticated}` prop
4. Enhanced validation logic to account for authenticated state
5. Updated field labels to conditionally show required asterisk

### User Flow

#### Non-Authenticated User
1. Clicks "Book Now" on a service
2. Sees toast: "Authentication Required - Please sign in to book a service"
3. Dialog closes automatically
4. Redirected to `/auth` (login/signup page)
5. After login, can return to book the service

#### Authenticated User
1. Clicks "Book Now" on a service
2. Dialog opens with pre-filled information:
   - Full Name (disabled)
   - Email (disabled)
   - Phone Number (disabled)
3. User only needs to:
   - Select preferred date
   - Add optional notes
4. Clicks "Proceed to Payment"
5. Redirected to Stripe checkout

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Faster booking**: No need to re-enter personal information
- **Fewer errors**: Pre-filled data reduces typos
- **Clear authentication**: Users know they need to login before booking
- **Security**: Ensures all bookings are tied to authenticated users

### Business Logic
- **Better tracking**: All bookings linked to user accounts
- **Data integrity**: User information is consistent across platform
- **Reduced fraud**: Authentication required for all transactions
- **Better analytics**: Can track user booking patterns

# Payment Issues - COMPLETE FIX

## 🔴 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: MongoDB Duplicate Key Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `E11000 duplicate key error collection: canadian-nexus.payments index: stripePaymentIntentId_1 dup key: { stripePaymentIntentId: null }`

**Root Cause**: The MongoDB index on `stripePaymentIntentId` was not sparse, preventing multiple documents with `null` values.

**Fix Applied**:
- Dropped the old non-sparse index
- Created new sparse index: `stripePaymentIntentId_1_sparse`
- Now allows multiple payments with `null` `stripePaymentIntentId`

### Issue 2: Webhook Body Parsing Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `Webhook payload must be provided as a string or a Buffer...Payload was provided as a parsed JavaScript object instead`

**Root Cause**: The `/api/stripe/webhook` route wasn't configured to use raw body parsing, so `express.json()` was parsing it first, breaking Stripe signature verification.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Added raw body parsing for BOTH webhook URLs
app.use('/api/webhooks', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));
app.use('/api/stripe/webhook', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));
```

### Issue 3: Webhook URL Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Stripe CLI sends to `/api/stripe/webhook` but server only had `/api/webhooks/stripe`

**Fix Applied**: Added route alias to support both URLs

## 🎯 All Fixes Summary

| Fix | Status | File |
|-----|--------|------|
| MongoDB sparse index | ✅ Fixed | Database |
| Raw body parsing for webhooks | ✅ Fixed | `server.js` |
| Webhook route alias | ✅ Fixed | `server.js` |
| req.user._id consistency | ✅ Fixed | `payments.js` |
| Enhanced webhook logging | ✅ Fixed | `webhooks/stripe.js` |

## 🚀 How to Apply All Fixes

### Step 1: Fix Database (COMPLETED ✅)
```bash
cd backend
node fix-mongodb-index.js
```
**Result**: Index fixed successfully!

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
The server has auto-restarted with the fixes. If not:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Or kill the process
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test a New Payment

1. Go to your app: http://localhost:8080
2. Select any service
3. Click "Book Now"
4. Complete payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Watch backend logs

**Expected Logs**:
```
🔔 ========== STRIPE WEBHOOK RECEIVED ==========
📨 Event Type: checkout.session.completed
→ Handling checkout.session.completed
=== CHECKOUT SESSION COMPLETED WEBHOOK ===
✅ Found payment in database: [payment_id]
✅ Payment status set to SUCCEEDED
```

### Step 4: Verify Payment Status

Check MongoDB or use the API:
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/payments/my-payments
```

Status should be: **"succeeded"** ✅

## 📋 What Each Fix Does

### 1. Sparse Index Fix
**Before**: Could only have ONE payment with `null` stripePaymentIntentId
**After**: Can have UNLIMITED payments with `null` stripePaymentIntentId
**Why**: Stripe doesn't provide payment intent ID until after checkout is created

### 2. Raw Body Parsing
**Before**: `express.json()` parsed body → Stripe signature verification failed
**After**: Webhook routes get raw Buffer → Signature verification works
**Why**: Stripe signatures are computed on the raw body, not parsed JSON

### 3. Route Alias
**Before**: Only `/api/webhooks/stripe` worked
**After**: Both `/api/webhooks/stripe` AND `/api/stripe/webhook` work
**Why**: Stripe CLI defaults to `/api/stripe/webhook`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB index is sparse (run `node fix-mongodb-index.js`)
- [ ] Backend server restarted
- [ ] Make a test payment
- [ ] Check backend logs for webhook processing
- [ ] Verify payment status is "succeeded" in database
- [ ] No more duplicate key errors
- [ ] No more webhook signature errors

## 🎉 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Payment Creation Flow
```
1. User clicks "Book Now"
2. Frontend calls POST /api/payments/create-checkout-session
3. Backend creates Stripe checkout session
4. Backend saves payment record (status: "pending")
   ✅ No duplicate key error (sparse index allows null)
5. User completes payment on Stripe
6. Stripe sends webhook to /api/stripe/webhook
   ✅ Raw body preserved for signature verification
7. Backend processes webhook event
8. Payment status updated to "succeeded"
   ✅ Webhook processed successfully
9. User sees success message
```

### Logs You Should See

**Payment Creation**:
```
Step 6: Creating payment record in database
Payment record saved successfully!
- Payment ID: [mongo_id]
- Payment Status: pending
- Amount: [amount]
```

**Webhook Processing**:
```
🔔 ========== STRIPE WEBHOOK RECEIVED ==========
📨 Event Type: checkout.session.completed
✅ Found payment in database: [payment_id]
✅ Payment [payment_id] status set to SUCCEEDED
✅ Successfully updated payment [payment_id]
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check MongoDB Index
```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.payments.getIndexes()

// Should show:
// { "stripePaymentIntentId_1_sparse": {"stripePaymentIntentId":1}, "sparse": true }
```

### Check Payment Status
```javascript
// In MongoDB
db.payments.find({}, { 
  stripeCheckoutSessionId: 1, 
  status: 1, 
  amount: 1 
}).sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(5)

// All recent payments should have status: "succeeded"
```

### Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
cd backend
node test-webhook.js
```

Should show:
```
✅ /api/stripe/webhook: WORKING
✅ /api/webhooks/stripe: WORKING
```

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Issue: Still getting duplicate key error
**Solution**: Re-run the index fix script:
```bash
node backend/fix-mongodb-index.js
```

### Issue: Webhook signature still failing
**Solution**: 
1. Check that server restarted after code changes
2. Verify `/api/stripe/webhook` is using raw body:
```bash
node backend/test-webhook.js
```

### Issue: Payment status still "pending"
**Solution**: 
1. Check if webhooks are being received (look for logs)
2. Manually fix stuck payment:
```bash
node backend/fix-payment-status.js YOUR_SESSION_ID
```
